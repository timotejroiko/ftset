# FTSet

FTSet, or Full Text Set, is an array-like data structure comparable to the javascript `Set` object but designed exclusively for storing strings and providing ultra fast full-text searching.

## FTSet comparison with Set and Array

* Like a Set, FTSet is a non-indexed datastore, it only stores values and not indexes
* Like an Array, the values are ordered by insertion in a single contiguous block and transversible from both ends
* Unlike an Array, operating on the beginning of the block (shift/unshift) is faster than operating on the end (push/pop)
* Unlike a Set, values are not hashed and FTSet does not prevent duplicate items for performance reasons
* FTSet implements several features from both the Set and the Array API, making it very flexible

FTSet is something in between a Set and an Array, it is 100% compatible with the Set API and most of the Array API.

## Why?

Recently i found out that matching lines using linux's native `grep` command on a text file is much faster than doing the same thing with the entire file loaded in memory as an array of lines, which essentially makes caching this kind of data not only useless but it actually made my entire application slower.

FTSet provides fast string matching features by storing its entire dataset as a single contiguous string block which makes the process of string matching an order of magnitude faster than looping over arrays, like an in-memory grep.

FTSet excels at storing a large number of strings with the purpose of quickly searching through them but may not be indicated for heavy read/write usage, check the benchmarks at the end of this readme.

## Real world example

Loading the full list of 500k+ catalogued asteroids in our solar system, downloaded from [https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/seasnam.txt](https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/seasnam.txt);

Basic preparations:

`npm install ftset`

```js
const { performance } = require("perf_hooks");
const { readFileSync } = require("fs");
const { execSync } = require("child_process");
const FTSet = require("ftset");

// approx. 10mb and 500k lines
let file = readFileSync("./seasnam.txt", "utf8");

// define "\n" as the delimiter, enabling the file to be used as is, no conversion or parsing needed
let fts = new FTSet(file, "\n");

// create an array of 500k items to compare with
let array = file.split("\n");
```

Case sensitive search for a single item:

```js
time = performance.now();
result = array.find(n => n.includes("Eris"));
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(result);
// => 10.449599981307983
// => 136199  Eris

time = performance.now();
result = fts.find("Eris");
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(result);
// => 0.38879990577697754
// => 136199  Eris
// ~ 30x faster
```

Case insensitive regex global search:

```js
// using array.filter() with regex match
time = performance.now();
result = array.filter(n => n.match(/eris/i));
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(result);
/*
=> 30.59500002861023
=> [
  '000871  Amneris',
  '028688  Diannerister',
  '084225  Verish',
  '121633  Ronperison',
  '136199  Eris',
  '237845  Neris'
]
*/
```

```js
// micro-optimized arrays
reg = /eris/i;
r = [];
time = performance.now();
for(let i = 0, x = 0, b = array.length; i < b; i++) {
    if(array[i].match(reg)) {
        r[x++] = array[i];
    }
};
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(r);
/*
=> 21.258599996566772
=> [
  '000871  Amneris',
  '028688  Diannerister',
  '084225  Verish',
  '121633  Ronperison',
  '136199  Eris',
  '237845  Neris'
]
*/
// about 30% performance gains but still slower than grep
```

```js
// using grep for comparison
time = performance.now();
result = child_process.execSync("LC_ALL=C grep -i -F 'eris' seasnam.txt", {encoding:"utf8"});
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(result);
/*
=> 13.034613132476807
=> 000871  Amneris
028688  Diannerister
084225  Verish
121633  Ronperison
136199  Eris
237845  Neris

*/
// much faster than any iteration method
```

```js
// using FTSet.matchAll()
time = performance.now();
result = fts.matchAll(/eris/i);
console.log(performance.now() - time);
console.log(result);
/*
=> 3.0929999351501465
=> [
  '000871  Amneris',
  '028688  Diannerister',
  '084225  Verish',
  '121633  Ronperison',
  '136199  Eris',
  '237845  Neris'
]
*/
// ~ 8x faster than arrays
// ~ 4x faster than grep
```

## API

Create a FTSet instance.

* `data` -> A string, array or iterable to fill the instance with. Defaults to empty string.
* `delimiter` -> A string to act as a delimiter. Defaults to the EOT character "\u0004".

### `.delimiter` -> String

Getter for the current delimiter in use. Also a setter for redefining the delimiter across the entire dataset.

### `.values()` -> Iterable

Returns an `Iterable` for compatibility with standard javascript classes.

### `.keys()` -> Iterable

Alias of `.values()` for compatibility with standard javascript classes.

Alias of `.values()` but calls back with `[value,value]` instead of `value`. For compatibility with standard javascript classes.

### `.reverse()` -> Iterable

Returns an `Iterable` in reverse order, starting from the last item and iterating backwards until the first item.

### `[Symbol.iterator]` -> Iterator

FTSet implements the `Iterable` and `Iterator` protocols so you can loop or iterate over an instance of FTSet directly.

## Other Benchmarks

Sample test run using the script in `bench/bench.js` on Node.js 15.3.0. Your milleage may vary depending on your CPU, your node.js version and several other factors so you are advised to perform your own tests.

Insert operations are surprisingly on pair with arrays, except for array.unshift which is absolutely terrible with a large number of items. Arrays are not designed for adding items to the beginning because the entire array needs to be reindexed, FTSet on the other hand has no problems with it. Sets are unordered and are slower because all items are hashed to check for uniqueness on every insert.

|| 99999 x 10 char | 9999 x 1000 char |
|-|-|-|
| array.push() | 53.147 | 1571.854 |
| set.add() | 71.045 | 1911.027 |
| FTSet.push() | 54.402 | 1595.230 |
| array.unshift() | 17773.719 | 2077.918 |
| FTSet.unshift() | 52.290 | 1519.934 |

Search operations are what FTSet is designed for, delivering much faster performance accross the board.

|| 99999 x 10 char | 9999 x 1000 char |
|-|-|-|
| array.find(includes) near beginning |  0.081 | 0.061 |
| FTSet.find() near beginning |  0.017 | 0.012 |
| array.find(includes) near end | 6.319 | 159.263 |
| FTSet.find() near end | 0.565 | 2.734 |
| array + Math.random | 0.046 | 0.009 |
| set + Array.from + Math.random | 0.681 | 0.051 |
| FTSet.random() | 0.078 | 0.009 |
| array.filter(includes) | 6.594 | 4.273 |
| FTSet.findAll() | 0.367 | 3.142 |
| array.filter(regex) | 6.615 | 8.152 |
| FTSet.matchAll() | 0.943 | 7.665 |

Delete operations have mixed results, with Sets being the fastest at deleting, Arrays at popping and FTSet at shifting.

|| 99999 x 10 char | 9999 x 1000 char |
|-|-|-|
| array.splice() | 0.344 | 0.787 |
| set.delete() | 0.051 | 0.006 |
| FTSet.delete() | 0.188 | 0.365 |
| array.pop() | 3.361 | 2.282 |
| FTSet.pop() | 13.276 | 17.775 |
| array.shift() | 5133.597 | 3.788 |
| FTSet.shift() | 8.616 | 3.083 |

Iterating over the entire data set is faster with arrays as expected, with some strange behavior coming from Sets.

|| 99999 x 10 char | 9999 x 1000 char |
|-|-|-|
| for(let i of array) | 4.210 | 2.130 |
| for(let i of set) | 5.485 | 169.628 |
| for(let i of FTSet) | 9.509 | 3.165 |
| array.forEach() | 3.875 | 1.251 |
| set.forEach() | 3.085 | 1.106 |
| FTSet.forEach() | 4.746 | 3.225 |
| array.map() | 4.540 | 1.533 |
| FTSet.map() | 5.516 | 4.597 |

## Caveat

javascript string concatenation makes use of v8's [ConsString](https://thlorenz.com/v8-dox/build/v8-3.25.30/html/df/d91/objects_8h_source.html#l09140) class which improves performance by not concatenating immediately and instead batch-processing several concats at once when needed. This may cause the first read operation in js to be much slower than normal when performed after a write operation because the read will force any pending concatenations in v8 to be processed before the string becomes readable. This slowness scales with data size, therefore FTSet may not be recommended for general purpose read/write usage on large datasets, it works much better for read-only or read-many/write-few use cases in those situations.

Example of the delayed first read using the above asteroids dataset:

```js
time = performance.now();
result = fts.find("Eris");
console.log(performance.now() - time, result);
// => 0.39865487397210759 136199  Eris

// write some data
fts.push("abc");

time = performance.now();
result = fts.find("Eris");
console.log(performance.now() - time, result);
// => 6.963500022888184 136199  Eris
// first read up to 20x slower due to lazy concatenation
// generally should still faster than array.find()

time = performance.now();
result = fts.find("Eris");
console.log(performance.now() - time, result);
// => 0.38657467654108987 136199  Eris
// performance is back to normal from second read onwards until the next write
```
